# TensorFlow Notepad Regressions

Code to learn to use TensorFlow regressions in javascript, following a Machine Learning course. The aim of the course is to understand the mathematics and programming techniques that are used in the most common Machine Learning algorithms.

"_TensorFlow.js is an open-source hardware-accelerated JavaScript library for training and deploying machine learning models._"

This project uses the node.js tensorflow package: [@tensorflow/tfjs-node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tensorflow/tfjs-node) version 0.2.1 in [node.js](https://nodejs.org) version 10.15.0 LTS.

## Notes

It was necessary to install Python on my PC for this to compile.
